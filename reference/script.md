GATE CLOSING

	**ANNOUNCER (V.O.)**
> Attention! Marmot Spacelines flight Mike Sierra Two Three Zero Four to Inercia Station. The Gate is closing.

### 2 INT. SPACEPORT SHIP HANGAR - BRIGHT LIGHTS

A green spaceship is on a metal platform. The spaceship is similar to a passenger aircraft, but with shorter rounder wings and no engines on undersides of the wings. The metal platform has guide markings in yellow. 

Camera rotates slowly around the spacecraft on human head height, looking up to it. The cockpit is in the middle of the view.

	**PILOT (V.O.)**
> Tower, Mike Sierra Two Three Zero Four, hangar 5, ready for departure, requesting taxi, over.

	**TOWER (V.O.)**
> Mike Sierra Two Three Zero Four, Tower. Go ahead with departure. Taxi to short hold, runway one. Report when held. Over.

	**PILOT (V.O.)**
> Go ahead with departure. Taxi to short hold, runway one. Report when held. Over.

### 3. INT. SPACESHIP COCKPIT - DARK

The camera looks over the controls console. The console is mostly dark. From the windows a big metal hangar door with two vertical halves is visible. A big yellow number 5 is painted on the doors.

Word TAXI appears on the console. A soft bleeb sound.
Heavy rumbling sound. The hangar door begins to open slowly.

CUT TO.

### 4. INT. TAXI CORRIDOR - BRIGHT LIGHTS

Camera is looking at the doors from the other side. The doors keep opening and the nose of the ship becomes visible.

Doors open fully. The platform under the ship starts to move towards the camera.

The music starts.

**CUT FORWARD IN TIME.**

The platform is moving along the Taxi corridor carrying the ship with it. The ceiling lights illuminate the ship. The ship is moving from spotlight to spotlight.

### 5. EXT. STARPORT ON LUNA SURFACE - DARK

Camera is looking down on a spaceport on the lunar surface. There are two parallel runways on different sides of a control tower. Control tower has windows up high and a rotating radar bar on top of the tower.

On the far side from the camera is the terminal building. It is wide and low. Made from grey metal. Has a row of low windows that emit yellow light.

Both runways are empty.

	PILOT (V.O.)
> Tower, Mike Sierra Two Three Zero Four. Holding short on runway one. Ready to proceed to launch. Over.

	TOWER (V.O.)
> Mike Sierra Two Three Zero Four. Proceed to runway elevator. Over.

	PILOT (V.O.)
> Proceed to runway elevator. Over.

CUT TO:

Camera looks at the end of the runway one. A double sided door similar to hangar door opens on the runway. The ship starts to rise up from under the ground. A rotating warning light is seen on the side of the ship. As the ship comes up the camera moves down and orbits to the side of the ship.

In the background are grey low hills. Above hills in the sky the space is visible with stars.

CUT TO:

### 6. INT. SPACESHIP COCKPIT - DARK

Lights come up in the controls console. The camera is looking left and right. The strings of lights on the sides of the the runway repeatedly light up and down from the craft to the other end of the runway, indicating direction of flight.

	(tower talks with another craft, telling it to hold in orbit?)

### 7. EXT. RUNWAY ONE - DARK

Camera orbits low from side of the ship to the front. The wings of the ship rotate to extreme positions and positions. When the movement of wings is over red light appears on the left wing and green light on the right wing. White strobe light appears on the top of the craft and a solid white light appears underneath.

	PILOT (V.O.)
> Tower, Mike Sierra Two Three Zero Four. Launch checklist cleared. Ready for engine start. Over.

	TOWER (V.O.)
> Mike Sierra Two Three Zero Four. Start engines, hold for launch. Over.

	PILOT (V.O.)
> Start engines, hold for launch.

Camera quickly orbits to behind the ship. The ship engines in the aft light up. Camera slowly rises up, looking at the other end of the runway over the spaceship.

	PILOT (V.O.)
> Tower, Mike Sierra Two Three Zero Four. Holding for launch. over.	

	TOWER (V.O.)
> Mike Sierra Two Three Zero Four. Runway one, cleared for takeoff.

	PILOT (V.O.)
> Mike Sierra Two Three Zero Four, Tower. Cleared for takeoff runway one.

Ship starts smaller engines underneath that start to lift it up from the runway while the main engine starts pushing it forward.

Camera orbits to the side and away from the ship.

Ship moves along the runway, gaining altitude. The landing gear is raised. Camera follows along with the ship until end of the runway. When the ship is cleared the runway the main engine fires up and the ship launches upwards into the space. Camera looks at the ship but no longer moves.

CUT TO.

### 8. EXT. SPACEPORT ON LUNAR SURFACE - DARK

Camera is looking down on the spaceport. Ship is moving fast towards the camera and on the trajectory of passing it from the right side.

	TOWER (V.O.)
> Tower, Mike Sierra Two Three Zero Four Contact orbital controller on frequenzy two thousand, over and out.

	PILOT (V.O.)
> Mike Sierra Two Three Zero Four, Tower. Contact orbital controller on frequenzy two thousand. Thank you. Over and out.

Camera follows ship from the side. The horizon descends in the background.

	PILOT (V.O.)
> Mike Sierra Two Three Zero Four, Orbital control. Climbing spinwise, angle 45 degrees. Altitude 60 kilometers. Transition to equator slingshot. Over.

	ORBITAL CONTROL (V.O.)
> Orbital control, Mike Sierra Two Three Zero Four. Cleared for equator slingshot. Over.

	PILOT (V.O.)
> Mike Sierra Two Three Zero Four, Orbital control. Cleared for equator slingshot. Over.

CUT TO.

### 9. EXT. LUNAR ORBIT - SPACE

Camera looks at the ship from behind. In the background Earth is seen rising up as the ship moves forward.

	PILOT (V.O.)
> "Dear passengers. Welcome to Marmot Spacelines flight Two Three Zero Four to Inercia station, Europa. We are about to slingshot around the moon. Please remain seated and keep your seatbelts on until Zero G light is turned on. Our subjective flight time is one week, two days and fourteen hours. Arrival will be in four sixteen hours standard time.

Thank you and have a pleasant flight."

Earth rises up and disappears again on the top of the screen. The ship leaves lunar orbit and continues into the space. Camera slowly orbits around the ship.

CUT FORWARD IN TIME.

### 10. EXT. EARTH LAGRANGE POINT GATE - SPACE

Large circular structure is floating in space. The ships white, red and green lights are seen in the distance, coming quickly closer.

CUT TO.

Camera follows the ship above it, looking towards the gate. A spiralling blue corridor starts to form behind the gate ring and extends into the space.

When the ship reaches the gate it suddenly strecthes out to be infinitely long and then disappears.

### 11. EXT. HYPERSPACE TUNNEL - BRIGHT BLUE AMBIENT LIGHT

Ship is bathed in pulsating blue light that is coming from all around.

CUT TO.

### 12. INT. SHIP COCKPIT 
The hyperspace tunnel spins rapidly in front of the ship.

### 13. EXT. EUROPA LAGRANGE GATE - SPACE

Another ring shaped gate lights up and the ship appears suddenly and for a moment floats freely while slowly rotating around.

Camera rotates around to show Europa in the distance. Further in the background Jupiter is glowing orange.

Ship lights up engines and starts to accelerate towards Europa.

Ship travels in space.

Ship stops acceleration and fires rotational thrusters to turn around.

CUT TO.

### 14. EXT. EUROPA ORBITAL STATION INERCIA - SPACE

A station with multiple ring structures and protruding landing bay areas spins slowly in space. A bright yellow light is seen in the distance.

	PILOT (V.O.)
> Station control, Mike Sierra Two Three Zero Four. Approaching, distance four kiloklicks.

	STATION CONTROL (V.O.)
> Mike Sierra Two Three Zero Four. Station Control.  Welcome to Europa. Cleared for approach. Report on visual.

	PILOT (V.O.)
> Cleared for approach. Report on visual. Mike Sierra Two Three Zero Four.

CUT TO.

Camera follows ship, looking past ship towards the station. Ship is facing the camera and firing the main thrusters.

Camera orbits around ship.
Ship stops main thrusters and turns to face the station.

	PILOT (V.O.)
> Station control, Mike Sierra Two Three Zero Four. Report on visual.

	STATION CONTROL (V.O.)
> Mike Sierra Two Three Zero Four. Station Control. Proceed to main bay.

	PILOT (V.O.)
> Proceed to main bay. Mike Sierra Two Three Zero Four.

### 15. EXT. EUROPA ORBITAL STATION INERCIA - SPACE

Camera looks at the station and moves away.
